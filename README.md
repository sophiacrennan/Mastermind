# Mastermind
I started this in summer 2019 right after I had taken an Object Oriented Design class. I wanted to apply my new knowledge of model, controller, view so I decided to create a game. I looked online for a fun game I could code in Java and found Mastermind. An overview of the game is that there is a randomly generated sequence of color and the user has to guess the sequence in a certain amount of tries. For each guess, a number is printed for how many colors are in the correct positions and another number for how many colors are guessed right but are not in the correct positions. I had a lot of fun writing the code for this as I really liked my Object Oriented Design class. The game is still a work in progress as I have not been able to make the controller work and need to finish writing tests. Two challenges I faced during this project were getting the controller to transfer information from the view to the model and vice versa, and changing the size of the visuals based on how long the sequence was set to. I have still not figured out either and will continue working on those problems when I have time. For now, I pass the model to the view directly by having the model be a field in the view.
